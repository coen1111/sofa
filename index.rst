Structural Optimization with FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint
======================================================


Introduction
============

Sofa, *Structural Optimization with FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint*, is a compilation of tutorials and examples used for the authors' research in Solid Mechanics. 

`FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org/>`_  is used to solve the PDEs in Solid Mechanics and `dolfin-adjoint <http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/>`_ automatically computes the adjoint derivative of the objective function. For a nice introduction to FEniCS, refer to `The FEniCS Tutorial <https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/>`_. For an application of FEniCS to Solid Mechanics, refer to `The FEniCS Book <https://fenicsproject.org/book/>`_ Chapters 26 & 27 and `Numerical Tours of Computational Mechanics with FEniCS <https://comet-fenics.readthedocs.io>`_.
